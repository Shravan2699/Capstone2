********************Can take out features after correlation itself....


Yes, you can consider removing features based on multicollinearity if they don’t add unique predictive value. Here’s a breakdown of the correlations:

High correlations among features:

HouseCount and PopulationCount (0.92): These two features are strongly correlated, so you might consider removing one of them to reduce redundancy.
CPI and HousePriceIndex (0.84): These are also strongly correlated, indicating some overlap.
Low correlation with the target:

If HousePriceIndex is your target variable, you might keep features that show a stronger relationship with it, like CPI.
ImmigrationCount has a negative correlation with HousePriceIndex and relatively low correlations with CPI, HouseCount, and PopulationCount, which could make it less informative.
Recommendation
Based on this analysis:

Consider removing either HouseCount or PopulationCount due to high collinearity.
If HousePriceIndex is your target variable, prioritize keeping CPI over ImmigrationCount, as it shows a stronger correlation with the target.
